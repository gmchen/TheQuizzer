__________What is The Quizzer?__________

The Quizzer: Chemistry Edition is a program to help with memorizing things.  Included are databases to help you memorize chemistry-related things such as Elements, Lab Equipment, Polyatomic Ions, and Solubility.  
With The Quizzer, you can also make your own databases to help you memorize anything you want, such as Super Smash Bros. moves.

__________Using The Quizzer:__________

Open (double click) TheQuizzer.exe.  The program will open.

To open a database, either press the Open Database button on the top-left of the screen or go to File-->Open Database.  Navigate to the database file(s), and press Open.

To begin, press Start.  Type in the answer to the question and press ENTER.

To play a 60 second timed game, press the Start Timed Game button.

To clear the database, go to File-->Refresh Database.

__________Additional Features:__________

Educational Enhancements:
A helpful setting for memorizing a list.  If a question is answered incorrectly, it will show up after the next turn.  Also, one in ten questions asked will be taken from the list of incorrectly answered questions and show up in blue.

Use Questions as Answers:
Uses both the question and answer of a database as questions.

Play with Points:
Play using a point system.

Button on the bottom-right:
Clicking this button will show a list of questions which were answered incorrectly.

__________Making Databases:__________

Databases are simply text files (.txt files), and are therefore easy to make.  Each line should contain a question and answer which follows the form

Q=A

where Q is the question and A is the answer.  The Quizzer accepts answers regardless of case or spaces, but displays them exactly as they are written in the database.

If there are alternate spellings of the quesitons and answers, separate them with semicolons.  For example,

Q1;Q2;Q3=A1;A2

has three spellings for the question and two for the answer.  Note that the first question and answer will be the ones displayed, although the others will be accepted.

Finally, if you would like some questions to be worth more points than others, add a % followed by a 'precedence' value between 1 and 3.  If the 'precedence' is not given, a default value of 2 is assigned.  Typically, important questions get a 3, somewhat important questions get the default value of 2, and obscure questions get a value of 1.  Questions with a 'precedence' of 3 receive less points but are penalized higher, and questions with a 'precedence' of 1 receive more points and are penalized lower.

A question with 2 possible spellings, 4 possible spellings for the answer, and a precedence of 3 should look like

Q1;Q2=A1;A2;A3;A4%3
